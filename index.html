  <p>Biografia de Andreanna</p>
   <p>I was born in Los Angeles California in 2005. I lived there with my parents and twin sister for 13 years before we moved to Guatemala. While in L.A. I danced, all kinds from ballet to salsa. We've lived in Guatemala for almost 4 years. We weren't supposed to be here for this long, it was supposed to be 6 months but we loved it here so much we decided to stay. My sister and I go to Antigua International School and since moving here I've been playing tennis.</p>
